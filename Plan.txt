ICT LEARNINNG PORTAL


this learning pprtal will be used to base our research upon.
Our research is about using interactive learning portal for students to learn at home. This learning portal is just going to be a prototype to base our research on and will not be a fully
functional application.

WHAT IS ICT?
ICT stands for "information communication and technology" 
and is made as a learning strand in senior highschool
in san guilliermo national highschool, ict mainly is teached
to students on how to operate and make use of computer devices
or other technological devices.

WHY A LEARNING PORTAL?
Since almost all students these days have a device to
use for school and our PRACTICAL RESEARCH teacher wants
us to make a prototype of a leaening portal to base our 
research on we will be using this learning portal to
base our research upon.


WHAT TO EXPECT IN THIS LEARNING PORTAL?
You expect to either be educated or be entertained.
